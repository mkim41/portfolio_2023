In<i>The Visual History of Type</i>, Paul McNeil describes that Transport ‚Äúperformed efficiently for so long that most people are completely unaware of them.‚Äù I saw this as an opportunity to shine a new light on Transport and modified the it based on its physical context - the highway and speed. I treated the letterforms as animation frames by duplicating and distributing them into the distance that shows an accelerated motion. The final font was created by merging these frames of letterforms.</p>

            <p>Sensing Fashion, the 2023 RISD Museum exhibit, asks: What happens when a garment designed to be worn enters a museum as a crisp, new envelope without the potential of wear and tear? The textures of these donated second-hand clothes were observed with a microscopic camera, and the resulting investigations were projected on the gallery walls for an intimate experience with the fabric. The identity and exhibit graphics were designed to illustrate the woven patterns of the textile and to complement the immersive sight of the garments.</p>
